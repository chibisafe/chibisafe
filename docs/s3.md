## S3 Object Storage

With the newly added support for S3 storage, you can now offload all your uploads to any S3-compatible storage of choice, like AWS S3, Backblaze, Wasabi, etc.
Settings for each provider might differ slightly but the main idea is that providing the following options, users can upload files directly to the storage:
- Region
- Bucket name
- Access key
- Access secret
- Endpoint
	- This is only used for services other than AWS
- Public URL
	- The full url right before the filename, so that links created by chibisafe are publicly accesible

These options are common across services that use the same S3 api that AWS provides, so a bit of tinkering of the Endpoint and Public URL should get your files going nicely.

### Bucket policy
You should modify accordingly, but a good starter point for your bucket policy is as follows. You can find the setting in your Bucket -> Permissions -> Bucket Policy.
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AddPerm",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::chibisafe-test/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)
As a starter point you can use these settings. Locking it down further is up to the user and outside of the chibisafe scope, so take this just as a starter point that needs tighter security. Bucket -> Permissions -> Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)

```json
[
    {
        "AllowedHeaders": [
            "*"
        ],
        "AllowedMethods": [
            "PUT"
        ],
        "AllowedOrigins": [
            "*"
        ],
        "ExposeHeaders": []
    }
]
```
